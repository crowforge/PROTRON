## Notes On GIT ##

The following are for a one man only software development project

# DEVELOPING - in a SPRINT #

Before you GIT check the following so you know where you are

- git branch
- git status
- git tag

You should be in your develop branch if writing new code.
Your master should contain working code from your last sprint.

Once new code is added the general sequence is

- git status
- git add .
- git commit -m "a note about the commit"
- git push origin <branch name>
- git status

# A RELEASE - end of sprint #

The sprint is over, a tested working copy now needs to be released 
to the master branch

Once you are sure you have added, committed and pushed all files to the development
branch then

- git checkout master			bring back the master branch
- git merge --no-ff develop     merge in all the new code
- git status					(just checking where you are)
- git tag
- git branch
- git push origin master		update the version of master in the remote repository
- git checkout develop 			bring back the development branch (now the same as master)
- git status					(just checking where you are)
- git branch

start working on the functionality required by the new sprint
